# SpecDetect: Simple, Fast, and Training-Free Detection of LLM-Generated Text via Spectral Analysis
This project provides the **initial version** of the source code for SpecDetect, a simple, fast, and training-free method for detecting LLM-generated text based on spectral analysis. Our method embeds the core implementation of Lastde (from [Lastde_Detector](https://github.com/TrustMedia-zju/Lastde_Detector)), and we sincerely thank the developers of the Lastde project for their open-source contribution.

> **Note**: This is the initial release of the SpecDetect codebase. We will update it with more complete implementations and detailed documentation in subsequent versions.

## Environment
The key dependencies of our experimental environment are as follows:
- Python 3.8
- Pytorch 2.0.0
- Other dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Code Structure & Implementation
The core logic of SpecDetect is organized in the following directories:
- `shell_scripts`: Contains executable scripts for triggering detection experiments (white-box/black-box settings).
- `py_scripts`: Includes core implementation code for spectral analysis, detection pipelines, and data processing (inherited and extended from Lastde).

### Run Detection
You can run the detection experiments via the scripts in `shell_scripts` (consistent with Lastde's execution mode):
```shell
cd shell_scripts

# White-box detection
./detection_white_box.sh 

# Black-box detection
./detection_black_box.sh
```
Detection results will be saved in the `experiment_results` directory (with subdirectories corresponding to different experimental settings).

## Acknowledgements
We are grateful to the authors of [Lastde](https://github.com/TrustMedia-zju/Lastde_Detector) for their open-source code and insightful research. Their work laid the foundation for the implementation of SpecDetect.
